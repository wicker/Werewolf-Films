# Werewolf-Films
Website collecting my favorite werewolf films

# Background

This one-page site is dynamically generated by the Python module in [movies.py]( ) from the [toptwelve.json]() file which contains the title, year of release, plot summary, poster art, and trailer link of my top twelve favorite werewolf films. 

# View the Site

The finished site is public at [jennerhanni.net/werewolf-films](http://jenenrhanni.net/werewolf-films/) and the source code is available in the [dist folder](https://github.com/wicker/Werewolf-Films/tree/master/dist).

# Reproduce the Site

First, fork and/or clone the repository to your local machine and change directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/wicker/Werewolf-Films.git
cd Werewolf-Films
```

The site is serving static images locally from the `dist/img` folder and it uses the Skeleton files in `dist/css`. Running the following command will update the `dist/index.html` file and open a web browser to view the page. 

```
python movies.py
```

To change the list of movies, edit the `toptwelve.json` file.
